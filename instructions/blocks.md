## Qengine - Blocks

The following is a list of the block types that come default with Qengine and are essential to understand in order to write questions.

#### qhtml
```
{%qhtml:namespace
    <p>Place HTML here</p>
%}
```
Any HTML here will be sent to the quiz front-end to be viewed by the student. You can use the Qengine shortcodes to automatically generate HTML input elements with the required attributes or to insert resources like images. Refer to [shortcodes.md](shortcodes.md) for a list of available shortcodes.

#### qcss
```
{%qcss:namespace
    p { color:red; }
%}
```
Any CSS styles you want to use with your HTML in a qhtml block can be set here.

#### files
```
{%files:namespace
    local_image.jpg
    https://example.com/some_remote_image.png
%}
```
You can use this block to retrieve files, which can be inserted into the qhtml block using a shortcode.

If referring to a remote file, do not use the entire url, only the actual file name.

Local files should be stored in the same folder as the `question` file.

#### qstore
```
{%qstore:namespace
    namespace.variable
    namespace.variable
%}
```

Variables generated by blocks are only stored if they are used in the current step. If you want to use a genereated variable in a different step you must store it using the `qstore` block.

#### qans
```
{%qans:namespace
    @@namespace.grade@@
%}
```

This block is used to report a grade of between 0 and 1 to the quiz front-end. Usually a grade is calculated in another block and stored in a variable, which is then put into this block. 

**!!!** *important â†’* This block can only be used once! Once it is used, no further steps will be processed.
