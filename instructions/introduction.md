## Qengine - Writing Questions

Qengine is a quiz engine, meaning that it is the back-end that assembles a quiz question (which is just an HTML form) and sends it to a quiz front-end for a student to interact with.

For example, you can use the LMS Moodle and use it's Opaque plugins as a front-end. They in turn can connect to Qengine as a back-end service that delivers questions.

#### Instructions
The instructions on writing questions and connecting to them are separated into the following files:
